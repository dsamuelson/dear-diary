## Description

This is a fully functioning back end program for a social media platform. Once run it sets up a Mongo database and uses express routing for API calls and database management.

From above you can see that creating a user is very simple, from there you can add thoughts, reactions and friends for this user

There are so many things to try and do:

Other than that the sky's the limit, all you need to do is prepare your front end to use the responses on this backend and you're good to go! Thank you for using this application!
